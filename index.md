Turku &hearts; Frontend is the #1 community for frontend developers and designers in Turku.

We organize monthly meetups, hackathons, programming competitions and other gatherings to promote developer culture. Our doors are open for everyone: beginners, curious, hobbyists, professionals and beyond.

Our meetups would not be possible without our [amazing speakers](/speakers).

Please note that everyone on our meetups is expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) so we can build a community that is open and welcoming to everyone.
